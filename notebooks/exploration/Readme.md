## How to implement EDA tasks in our common EDA github repository  

* step 1 : send me your name and github id via emanuel afessa slack 
* step 2 : you will receive and email giving your collaboration rights on git repo
* step 3 : work on data_exploration branch and when finished push your work to main branch 
-> Duplicate the template and rename it EDA_<yourfirstname>_<yourlastname>.ipynb
-> If possible For each graph write the code and in mardown your conclusion the graph like so :

* step 4 : your work will be merged and contribution visible on main
